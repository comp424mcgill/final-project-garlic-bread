Implementation stuff
- determine available moves
- evaluate whether a position/move ends the game and also evaluate which player wins in such a state
	- game ends when there is no path from player to player
	- compute how many distinct paths there are from 1 player to another?
	- how many walls would be required to block the path from A to B
	- would this move allow the game to be ended and who would win?
Strategy
- never end turn with 3 walls arouund you if opponent is fewer than M steps away
- randomly move initially (or just use simple heuristic), then search when there are fewer moves available
- alpha beta pruning -> in a certain state, if a certain player can win with a move, there is no need to consider other moves
- herusitic: minimum number of walls to enclose the player
- determine conditions for switching from simple heuristic to alpha-beta search
