### Report Grade (41.75/50) 

#### TA Feedback 

Technical Approach: Creative use of iterative deeping for dealing with board size/search space in this problem with minmax, interesting analogy with nonrandomized MCST.
Motivation for Technical Approach: fits well with analysis given above. would be 
Pros/cons of Chosen Approach: More detail/analysis would be appropriate here. Some right ideas but more concrete explanation of how/why needed to convince
Future Improvements: Some good ideas here. Would like a bit more detail for the latter two (higher level approach proposals more important than explanation of why a certain implementation didn't work)
Language and Writing: the abstract is perhaps overstated but that's a nitpick, I appreciate the effort to give this report broader context. Overall well written.
Organization: Very well organized overall. A note about abstracts: they're not the same thing as introductions! an abstract should be independent of the report itself (i.e. you could read either one on its own, they are often printed separately). So there is some context missing at the beginning of your actual report (since it's in the abstract). Bit of a nitpick but you'll find out about abstract writing at some point, might as well be now. 

Report grader: Michael
